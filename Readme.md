# Snake Game AI with Heuristic-Based Algorithm

https://github.com/metflekx/snake-ai/assets/106245122/b0992975-6650-433a-90d3-c711f8736b0c

Welcome to the Snake Game AI project! In this repository, 
I have implemented a Snake Game AI using Python, Pygame, and Numpy.
This AI plays the classic Snake game autonomously by following 
a heuristic-based algorithm to minimize the cost while avoiding collisions
and maximizing its score. No machine learning libraries are used,
and everything is implemented from scratch.


## Installation

Provide instructions on how to set up the project on a local machine. Include any dependencies that need to be installed and steps to run the game.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-ai.git
cd snake-game-ai

# Install dependencies
pip install pygame numpy

# Run the game
python snake_game.py
```


### Licence
The project is Licenced under the MIT Licence.
